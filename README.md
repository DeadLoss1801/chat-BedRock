# chat-BedRock

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that gives you access to foundation models (FMs). Being serverless means there is no infrastructure to care about. However, you still have access to some powerful features (for some models) like fine-tuning with your own data and agents, which you can look at as tools you can create yourself to supercharge your FM with abilities it usually doesnâ€™t have. For example, you could create an agent to query a database or talk with an external API.
